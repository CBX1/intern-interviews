      <p> Nice to meet you! My name is Keshav, I'm a student studying Computer Science and Math. I have experience with full stack development and love solving interesting problems.</p>
      <p> I want to work for Lob because I think the api is very interesting. It is the first time I've seen an api that tracks mail in real time for business owners and I wish to learn how the api works internally. In addition, I enjoyed the creativity in the github challenge and think I would enjoy working with this team on the product.</p>
 
      <p> My main hobbies are playing chess and playing the guitar. See if you can checkmate black in this puzzle.</p>

        <p> I have a pet dog named Mario. He's about 10 years old and is a Malt-Tzu, a mix between a Maltese and Shih Tzu. He enjoys going into cramped spaces and getting stuck.  </p>
